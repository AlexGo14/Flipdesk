#Flipdesk

##What is it?
  Flipdesk is a fast and lightweight helpdesk system.

##What is special about Flipdesk?
  You, as a service company, are able to manage multiple customer/organisations. You are able to customise the ticket status fields and ticket fields. That means that you can improve your service in the way to create mandatory ticket fields for an organisation. In this way you save time and do not need to ask your customer about necessary information he should provide you.

##Code
  Based on NodeJS and compatible with PostgreSQL, MySQL/MariaDB and SQLite, Flipdesk is fast.

  Please, keep in mind that Flipdesk is not ready yet. I am very short on time, but I will fix open bugs asap.
  You can find all development code in branch "Development". If a stable version of Flipdesk is available, I will update the master branch.
